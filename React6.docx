		Javascript - Module - System

Modular means (part by part)[ before that all are lagacy]

-modular refers to part-by-part
-modular approach allows to use application specific framework or library.
-in includes only the required library for application.
it enables
	a) Reusability
	b) Extensibility
	c) Maintanability
	d) Testability
-It makes application light weight and faster in interactions.
-To use modular approach in javaScript it requires various module systems to setup for project.
	a) Common JS
	b) UMD(Universal Module Distribution)
	c) AMD(Asunchronous Module Distribution)
	d)ESModule etc.
	
-Javascript in browser uses ESModule, which is the default for browser.


Module
-Javascript file is considered as a module in JS library.

Module
-Javascript file is considered as a Module in JS library.

		home.js 		//home  -is module name
		
-module can have a set of
	a) variables
	b) functions
	c) classes

- Every member in a module is not accessible outside the module scope.
- If you want to access any member outside module scope then you have to mark it as "export".

export const name = value;
exprot function name() {}
export class name{}

-You can import into any page and use in application

	import {name} from "moduleName";	ESmodule System
	
	const ref = rquire("moduleName");	//CJS Require JS
	ref.name;
	
- You can export any member after configration by using "default".
	
	const Hello = function() {
	
	}
	
	export default hello;
	
-Every module can have only one default export.
-Default member is imported without a "{}" block.
-it can't be the last be import.

		import defaltMember, {other} from "moduleName";
		
	You can import library from multiple modules.
	
	import {a} from "module1";
	import {b} from "module2";
	
   -You can import all member by using aliasing.
   
   import * as aliasName from "module";
   aliasName.member;
   
   Note:  Default member can't be imported using aliasing.
   import defaultMember, * as aliasName from "module";
   
   
   if multiple module have same name members then you have to imp using "aliasing" technique

	import {A as module1} from "module1"
	import {A as module2} from "module2"
