What is React?

React have two major versions upto 18 is one type it's having one library 
it's javscript library for builiding user Interface
[upto 18x] React is javascript 

we never use javascript for user interface
before react library we use jquery  for create any ui

it's a javascript library for web and native UI(mobile/android) [from 19x]

next.js remex remedy 

Can we build application using React?
yes with support of framework like Next js.

What is difference between React & Angular

react is a library. can build UI but can not controll the application flow.

angular is a framework. we can build full application and we can controll the application flow.

why we need React like library?

to build spa & pwa



what are the mejor challenges in modern web Development?
-1.Unified User Experience(across any device)
-2.Fluid Ux there will be (azax in javascript-topic)
-3.modular (your required less but you import lotof its bad)
-4.Loosely Coupled & Extensible



example:-
{
<script type="module">
import{f2} from "..............."
---------.innerhtml = f2();
</script>
}


ex

youtube =====>optimize===-->
								low-bandwidth
								mobile(browser)

pc(browser)			


what is solution?

better to build single-page-application & progressive web application you feel app inside the browser website

how to build SPA

-javascript & jquery we can build SP-application

what are issues with js & jquery

lot of Dom interaction.
lot of dom manipulation.
lot of Bom interactions.
lot of code .

what are the Features of React?

 
 
 
 that is principle of any program  DRY (don't reapeat your self)
 
rewrite  no
reuse yes


<input type="date"> it's knon as element but it's is component like date picker

Features of React:
1. it's component based.
		-Component comprises of markup syles & logic.
		-Easy to reuse & extend.
		-Easy maintain and test
		-Faster in building application
		
2. it's moduler
		-it is light weight
		-it uses less memory
		-it is faster in interactions.

3. it usese "Virtual Dom"
		-Fast in rendering output.

4. it uses One Way Binding
		-Data binding is One way implicitly.
		-You need to configure two way binding expllicitly.
			

FAQ's:

what is dom(do me is hirarachy of elements of this page)


how dom is formed?

Markup=> Bytes=> Chars=>Tokens=>node([element])=>Dom=>layout=>rendering=>paint


what is shadow DOM?

hirarachy of elements in a component[shadow-root]

what is virtual dom?
it is a copy of acutual DOM in memory.
it makes the rendering fast However it requires updates into Actual DOM.



Issues With React:

	-Virtual DOM in memory 
	-Implicit one way binding
	-Lot of 3rd party integration required
	-Lot of Gap's
	
	
	Setup Developement Environment for React:
	
		-Sandbox server(Repository)
		-development server(Appliction)
		-quality server
		-production server(Go-live)
	
	minified files like (production files) style.min.css/index.min.js
	
	dist/build
	
	 
	Developement
	quality
	production
	
	
React in existing web Application:

1. create a new folder for project at any location on your device 
	
2. Open project folder in visual studino code editor
3. Run the following command in project terminal
> npm init -y 
(it generate "package.json", which comprises of project meta data.)

4. Add following files & folder into project
			README.md files

			File/Folder				Description
			Package.json			project meta data
			Readme.md				help document by developer for developers
			.gitignore 				congiguration of files to ignore while publishing on to GIT
			public 					comprises of static resources like HTML, Images , documents[pdf,docx,xslx,mkv, avi, json]
			src 					comprises of dynamic resources like sass, css , js jsx ts, tsx etc
			index.html 				startup page for application

	
5.Add a new page "home.html" into public folder

6. Add <noscript>element into body section it is used to verify the status of javascript in browser.

		<noscript>
			please enable jabascript on your browser
		</noscript>
		
7. Add a root container into actual DOM which renders the content from Virtual DOM

			<div id="root"></div>

8. To enable React in any HTML page you need following libraries

		a) React	  : it is the core react library that provides all react function.
		b) react-dom  : it is library of creating and handling Virtual Dom.
		c) babel	  : it is a javascript compiler
		
		javascript? javascript is a light weight interpreted and jit compiled programming language. 
		jit -> just in  time
		aot -> head of time
		
	-React upto 18x version provides CDN for 'react & react-dom'.
		https://legacy.reactjs.org/ => docs => CDN
		
		-Copy cd for developement environment and paste into your HTML page <head> section.
		
		<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

	-Go to babel official website
	
	https://babeljs.io/ => docs => integrated Packages => @babe/shtandlone
	
	-Copy standlone CDN and paste into HTML page <head> below react-dom library.
	
	<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
		
	-Add <script> element into <head> section with type as "text/babel"
	<script type="text/babel">
	</script>
	
	.Create a  virtual DOM and render into actual DOM 
	
	//React 17x
	
	ReactDOM.render("massage | component",document.getElementById("root"));
	
	//React 18x

 const root  = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
 root.render("massage|component");
 
 
 You can install all libraries into project
 
		>npm install react@18 react-dom@18 @babel/standalone --save 
		
		-All library files are copied into "node_modules".
