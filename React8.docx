React Data Binding
Data binding is a technique of accessing data from source and bind to UI elements. it identifies the changes in UI and updates into source.
-Data binding techniques are classified into 2 types.
1. One Way Binding
2. Two Way Binding

React implicitly support One way Binding.
-It makes the data in UI elements read-only.
-You can bind data using a data binding expression "{}".

syntax
	var user = "John";
	<p> Hello!{user} </p>
	<input type="text" value={user}/>

Note:   Variables are not recommended to handle data in a component.
		They are immutable, and component requires mutable reference.

State in component
  -Web applications use "http / https" as protocals
  -they are stateless protocalls.
  they can't remember data between requests.
  -hence various state management techniques are required to handle data for component.
  
 Local State: 
	-A React Component comprises of various phases
	
	create component => mout component => update component => unmout
	
	-A local state is configured for comonent while creating the component.
	-Local state can handle any type of data
				a) Primitive
				b)Non Primitive
	-You can access the local state by using  a React Hook "useState()"
	
	-Hook is aservice that provides pre-functionality, which you customize and implement according to the requirements.
	-Technically hook is function.
	-useState() hook return  2 references 
	a) getter for reading and returning value 
	b)setter 	for assingning a new value
	
Syntax: 

		const [getter,setter] = use State(value);
		
		const [user setUser] =useState('john');
		
		const [stock, setStock] = useState(true);
		
		const [products, setProducts] = useState(['tv','mobile']);
		

	FAQ's:
	
	1. can we use var or let keywords for configuring useState()?
	A: Yes But not recommended.
	
	2. Why var & let not recommended for state?
	A: State requires intialization. it should not allow declaring & assignment.
	var & let  can skip initialization. Hence they are not recommended. 
	
	3. How you can assign a new valueusing setter if state is configured with "const"?
	A. By re-initializing memory for const you set a new value.
	
	Syntax:
			const[user,setUser] = useState("john");
			setUser = "david"  //invailid
			setUser("david");		//valid
			
	-You can not set state while creating a component.
	-State allows to set value "on mount" or "on update".
	
	-Component mout and unmout can be configured by using the hook "useEffect()".
	
	Syntax: 
	
			useEffect(() => {},[dependencies])
			
	-Component mounts only once.
	-If you want a component to remount then, you have to configure the dependencies.
	-So that component can remount when ever dependency changes.
	
	
	Handling various Data types in React:
	1. Number 
		-A number can be ay one of the follwing
				Signed integer
				unsigne integer
				float
				double
				decimal
				exponent
				binary
				hexadecimal
				octa 
			Big In [245334534n]
	-Number methods are same as in js
		toFixed()
		toPrecision()
		toLocalString()
	-Parsing is same
		parseInt()
		parseFloat()
	-Verifyint number is same
		isNaN ()
	
	Data Binding
	useState()
	useEffect()
	Handle Various Data Types 
	
	-Number
		toFixed()
		toPrecision()
		toLocaleString()
	-String
		-String formatting
		-String configuration
		-String manipulation
		
	-Boolean Types
		-True 
		-False
		
		Boolean types handles "true" & "false"
		-act can use booleand value but can't display the boolean value.
		-You have to render conditional data using boolean.
	Note: jsx will not allow any statement inside JSX element.
	-You have to handle all actions on boolean by using operators or methods.
syntax:
		const[stock, setStock] = useState(true);
		<p>{stock ? "in stock" : "not in stock"}</p>
	

Null Type:
		-It is used to define values at runtime.
		-If avalue is not probided into reference at runtime then it uses "null",
		-React can't display null, but can use null as keyword.
syntax:
		const [price , setPrice]  = useState();
		setPrice(prompt("Enter Price"));
		<p>{(price === null) ? "price Required": price}</p>

Symbol Type 
		-it is same as in JS 
		- it is used to hide a key in object
		-
syntax 	
		var id = Symbol();
		var product= {
			[id]: 1;
			name: "tv"
			qty: 5
		}
		
		product[id]		//to access individually.

	Array Type
		{
			-All array rules same as in JS
			-Array configuration
			-Array Elements.
			-Array Methods.
			-Array distructure is same in js.
			-Array spread approach is same.
			
		}
		
Object Type
		-Object configuration with key & value is same as in JS.
		Object manipulation is also same.
	Syntax: 
			const[product] = useState({key:value, key:value});
			-Reading all keys from object
			a)for..in
			b)Object.key()
			
			-Delete a key from object
			a) delete operator
			
			-Hide a key in object 
			a) symbol data type
			
			-Verify keys
			a)"in" operator
	
	Syntax: 
			const [product] = useState({id:1, Name:"TV", ShippedTo:["delhi","hyd"], Rating:{rate:4.5,count:3500}});
	
	
	<p>{product.Name}</p>
	<p> {product.Rating.rate}</p>
	{
		product.ShippedTo.map(item => <div key={item}>{item} </div>)
	}
	

Array 	 []
Object 	 {}
Data 	[{}, {}]

map Type:
	-Map is a key & value collection.
	-Key & value can be any type.
	-All interations are handled by implicit methods.
	it is faster in interactions when compared to object.
	it is schema less[structure less].
	
Syntax: 
		const[data] = useState(new map());
		
		data.set()
		data.get()
		data.delete()
		data.clear()
		data.has()
		data.keys()
		data.values()
		data.entries() etc......
		
Ex:	
		data.set(key,value)
		data.get(key)
		
	Date Type
			-Date & Time value are configured using "Date()" constructor.
			
			Date & Time methods are same as in JS.
			
		getHours()			setHours()
		getMinutes()		setMinutes()
		getSeconds()		setDate() etc.....
		getMilliSeconds()
		getDay()
		getDate()
		getMonth()
		getFullYear()
		toDateString()
		toTimeSring()
		toLocalDateSring()
		toLocalTimeString()   
						
			etc.........
		
	-React uses 3rd party date libraries to manipulate date and time values.
	-The popular 3rd party date libraries for React
		a)Moment
		b)Day.js
		c)Luxon
		
Setup Moment library for React App:
	
	1. Install library
				>npm install moment --save
	2.import moment into component.
	import moment form "moment
	
	3.Configure date
		const[departure] = useState(new Date());
		
	4. Display date using moment
			{moment(departure).format("date &time literals")}
			
			ddd 	short week day
			dddd 	long week day
			DD 		date number
			MM 		month number
			MMM 	short month name
			MMMM 	long month name
			YY 		short year number
			YYYY	 long year number
		
	Ex:
			{moment(departure).format("DD dddd, MMMM YYYY)}
	Note: Input date format must be always "year-month-day hrs:min:sec.milliSec".
	
	 
Regular Expression Type
	
		-it is same as in JS.
		- it is used to verify format of input value by using meta characters & quantifiers.
		-it is enclosed in "//"
		-it is verified using string "match()" method.
		
	Syntax:
			const [mobile] = useState("9876543210");
			{(Mobile.match(/+91\d{10}/)? "verified" : "invailid"
	
	Summary:
	
	- number
	- string
	- boolean
	- null
	- undefined
	- symbol
	- big int
	- array
	- object
	- map
	- date
	- regular expression
	
	
			Distributed computing
	
-Distributed computing allows communication between two applications running on two 
different machines.

-it also allows communication between two object in two different process of same machine.

	
	Distributed Technologies
	
	CORBA			common object Request Broken Architecure[14 languages]
	DCOM 			Distribute component object model[visual Basic]
	RMI 			Remote method Invocation[J2EE]
	Java Beans		Java
	Remoting		.NET
	Webservice		All technologies[c, java, .net , php, python etc..]
	
	Communication Specificatioins:

		SOAP 	[Service Oriented Architecure Protocol]
		REST	[representational State Transfer]
		JSON 	[Javascript Object Notation]

	SOAP
		-services consumer sends xml request
		-Server provider sends xml response
	
		Request:
				<Products>
					<product>
						<Category>Electronics</Category>
					</product>
				</Products>
		Response:
				<Products>
					<product>
						<id>4</id>
						<Name>Tv</Name>
						<Category><Electronics</Category>
					</product>
					.....
				</Products>
					
	REST
			-Consumer sends a query request.
			-Provider sends XML or JSON.
			
		Request:
				https://server.com/data/products?category=electronics
				http://server.com /data/products/electronics

		Response
			[
				{id:4, Name:'TV", Category:"Electronics"},
				.....
			]
	
	JSON 
		-consumer sends json request.
		-provider sends JSON response.

issue with web services:
		-it uses soap
		-it can be used only on http or https.
		-it can run only on web server.
		-XML 

API
	-applicaton programming Interface
	-it uses REST & JSON
	-it can be used on any protocol.
	-it can run on any server
	-it is available across all devices and OS services.
