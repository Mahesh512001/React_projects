-Distributed computing allows communication between two applications running on two 
different machines.

-it also allows communication between two object in two different process of same machine.

	
	Distributed Technologies
	
	CORBA			common object Request Broken Architecure[14 languages]
	DCOM 			Distribute component object model[visual Basic]
	RMI 			Remote method Invocation[J2EE]
	Java Beans		Java
	Remoting		.NET
	Webservice		All technologies[c, java, .net , php, python etc..]
	
	Communication Specificatioins:

		SOAP 	[Service Oriented Architecure Protocol]
		REST	[representational State Transfer]
		JSON 	[Javascript Object Notation]

	SOAP
		-services consumer sends xml request
		-Server provider sends xml response
	
		Request:
				<Products>
					<product>
						<Category>Electronics</Category>
					</product>
				</Products>
		Response:
				<Products>
					<product>
						<id>4</id>
						<Name>Tv</Name>
						<Category><Electronics</Category>
					</product>
					.....
				</Products>
					
	REST
			-Consumer sends a query request.
			-Provider sends XML or JSON.
			
		Request:
				https://server.com/data/products?category=electronics
				http://server.com /data/products/electronics

		Response
			[
				{id:4, Name:'TV", Category:"Electronics"},
				.....
			]
	
	JSON 
		-consumer sends json request.
		-provider sends JSON response.

issue with web services:
		-it uses soap
		-it can be used only on http or https.
		-it can run only on web server.
		-XML 

API
	-applicaton programming Interface
	-it uses REST & JSON
	-it can be used on any protocol.
	-it can run on any server
	-it is available across all devices and OS services.
	
	
	 JavaScript AJAX techiniques:
	 
	1. XMLHttpsRequest
			-it is browser object used to make AJAX calls in browser
			-it is native object of borwser
			
	 
	a) Configure a reference for XMLHttpsRequest
	
		let http = new XMLHttpsRequest();
		
	b) Configure the request by using "open()" method
	http.open("method","url", async:boolean);
	
	method 		:GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, PURGE, DELETE
	url 		: refers to request path
	async 		:true will use unblocking technique false with use bloking technique.
	c) Send the request by using "send()" method
			http.send();
	d) Execute request by using "onreadystatechange" event
	
	http.onreadystatechange = function() {
	
	}
	
	-Request is processed in 4 states
		1  	initial
		2  	Success
		3  	Complete State
		4	Ready State
	
	classless inter domine routing
	
	e) Fetch data on ready state
	
		if(http.readyState === 4)
	{
		// you can acess the response
		// response can be in various format
		
		http.responseText 	[string format]
		http.respnseXML		[xml format]
	}
		
		The default respnse format is"text".
		if your data is not text or xml then itrequires explicit parsing.
	
	
1. XMLHttpsRequest in React
	
	-React can use XMLHttpsRequest object
	-it can handle AJAXrequestusing XMLHttpRequest

Issues	
	 -it is browser object
	 -React uses Virtual DOM,hencebrowser object are not recommended.
	 -it is not async by default it requires explicit async configuration.
	 -it return response in Text OR XML only. it requires explicit conversions for other data types.
	 -Converting datamy lead to CORS issues.
	 -Secuirity issues
	 -It is not good in error handling.
	 
2. Javascript "fetch()" promise

 - Promise is async by default
 - It returns data in binary format.
 - It requires explicit conversions.
 - It is simplified when compared to XMLHttpRequest.
 - It is better in error handling.
 
Syntax:
		fetch("url")
		.then(function(response){return response.json()})
		.then(function(data){})
		.catch(function(error) {})
		.finally(function() {'excecute always'})
	 
	 
issues  with fetch() in react

	-it returns data in binary.
	-Explicit conversions are required.[COM to Marshal]
	-CORS issues.
	- XSRF issues [Cross Site Request Forgery]
	-XSS issues [Cross site SCripting attacks]
	-You can't cancel the request.
	
3. Using 3rd party React Libraries
		-There are various 3rd party libraries designed for handling AJAX request in React.  
		-axios 
		-WhatwgFetch
		-telerik 
		-Jquery AJAX etc...
		
Axios for React:

		-it is promise based
		-it is async by default.
		-it returns rsponse with various details like
			a)statusCode
			b)statusText
			c)data
			d)headers etc.
		-Data is in it's native format.
		-Explicit conversions are not required
		-Better in handling CORS XSS XSRF etc.
		- it can cancel reqeust
		- It can handle multiple request simultaneously at the same time.
		
		
1. Install axios for your project
		>npm install axios --save
		
2. Import axios into component and configure the Request

		import axios from "axios";
		
		axios.get()		for fetch
		axios.post()	for save
		axios.put()		for update/modify
		axios.delete()	for delete
		
		
		Syntax:
				axios.get('URL')
						.then(function(response){
				respnse.status
				respnse.statusText
				respnse.headers
				rsponse.data
				})
				.catch(function(error){
				//on error
				})
				.finally(function() {
					//always inovked
				})
